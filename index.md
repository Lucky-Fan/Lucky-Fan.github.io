Hello, I am Fan Wu (吴帆). I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the department of civil and environmental engineering at [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/), Edmonton, Canada. I obtained my PhD degree from [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/), and I hold a Master's degree from [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://www.hit.edu.cn/) and a Bachelor's degree from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/) in China. 

Currently, I am engaged in research and projects supported by Industrial Research Chair (IRC) Grant from [NSERC](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/). My work also involves projects collaborating with industry partners such as [TELUS](https://www.telus.com/en), [Stantec](https://www.stantec.com/en), [Acadis IBI Group](https://www.ibigroup.com/), and [ATS Traffic](https://www.atstraffic.ca/). Additionally, I serve as the team leader and coordinator for one of the projects.

<!-- The primary objectives include developing and enhancing a broader range of applications for Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology, thereby improving traffic management efficiency, bolstering safety in mobility, and enhancing the overall travel experience for all participants within the transportation system. -->
